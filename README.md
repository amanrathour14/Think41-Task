# Think41-Task Project

A project with milestone-based development workflow.

## Quick Start

### Committing Milestones

Use the provided scripts to easily commit and push milestones:

**Using PowerShell script:**
```powershell
.\commit-milestone.ps1 -MilestoneNumber 2 -Description "Backend Foundation"
```

**Using batch file:**
```cmd
commit-milestone.bat 2 "Backend Foundation"
```

**Manual git commands:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Milestone 2: Backend Foundation"
git push origin main
```

### Milestone Workflow

1. **Work on milestone tasks** - Complete all tasks for a milestone
2. **Update MILESTONES.md** - Mark completed tasks with ✅
3. **Commit milestone** - Use the script or manual git commands
4. **Push to remote** - Automatically done by the script

### Project Structure

```
Think41-Task/
├── backend/          # Backend application
├── frontend/         # Frontend application
├── MILESTONES.md     # Milestone tracking
├── commit-milestone.ps1  # PowerShell script for commits
├── commit-milestone.bat  # Batch file wrapper
└── README.md         # This file
```

### Git Best Practices

- **Atomic commits**: Each milestone should be a single, meaningful commit
- **Clear messages**: Use descriptive commit messages
- **Regular pushes**: Push after each milestone to avoid losing work
- **Branch strategy**: Consider feature branches for complex milestones

### Viewing Progress

- Check `MILESTONES.md` for current progress
- Use `git log --oneline` to see commit history
- Use `git status` to check current state

## Development

This project uses a milestone-based development approach where each major feature or phase is committed and pushed separately. This creates a clean, traceable history of project development.
